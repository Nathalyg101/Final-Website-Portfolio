              <p class="sec-banner-text"><b class="sec-banner-text">Dragon Vector Art</b> is a personal work I developed on my own.
                The purpose behind was to celebrate the new year, while doing some research I 
                discovered 2024 would be the year of the dragon in the chinese lunar calendar. So 
                as to represent both special occasions, I came up with the idea of integrating a 
                dragon into my work and combine its body with the number 24.</p>

                challenge visual appeals and consider character actions critically. By using illustration as a vital component to

              <p class="sec-banner-text"><b class="sec-banner-text">WWF campaign</b> was built around WWF's values and branding elements to raise awareness about endangered species, with
                the target audience being kids, I worked to develop ideas and collaborations that would attarct both kids and parents attentions.
                Therefore, I chose to team up with pokémon in order to raise awareness and bring that curiousity and joy kids get from watching and 
                learning about their favorite pokémon!</p>
